# Data_Augmentation_Yolov3
In machine learning, sometimes we need plenty of data to train our models. In this code, i made data augmentation code in python when using the yolov3 network.
I use python library IMGAUG. By using this, the images and their annotations(Bounding-box) changed automatically.
